I work on syntax and its interface with semantics and phonology. I am currently interested in these topicsː <br> 
* Argument structure
* Linearization
* Focus and alternatives <br>
  
I work primarily on Chinese languages.


## Unselected Objects in Mandarin Chinese
I revisit the 'unselectiveness' of objects in Mandarin Chinese (i.e., literally “John ate restaurant”, meaning ‘John ate at the restaurant’). I propose a novel empirical generalization that there are three structually different unselected constructions, each of which has a structure derived by independent motivations.

## Obligatory OV order in Wu Chinese
(with Andrew Simpson) <br>
Wu Chinese is a SVO language while possesses obligatory OV order. We argue that it is not driven by information structure, by an autoreflex of syntax. The OV order is conditioned by the interacton of voice, aspect, and nominal properties.
