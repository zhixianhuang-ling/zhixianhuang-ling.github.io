I work on syntax and its interface with semantics and phonology. I am currently interested in these topicsː <br> 
* Argument structure
* Linearization
* Focus and alternatives <br>
  
I work primarily on Mandarin Chinese and my home variety Jiaxing Wu Chinese, of which I am a native speaker.

## Obligatory OV order in Wu Chinese
* (with Andrew Simpson)
* Wu Chinese is a SVO language while possesses obligatory OV order. We argue that it is not driven by the information structure, by an autoreflex of syntax. The OV order is conditioned by the interacton of voice, aspect, and nominal properties.

* Outputs:
  * Obligatory OV order in Wu Chinese. Talk presented at the 12th International Conference on Wu dialects. Oct 25-27, 2024. Zhejiang University.
  * Issues of OV/VO word order in Wu Chi- nese. Talk presented at the 36th North American Conference on Chinese Lin- guistics (NACCL-36). Mar 22-24, 2024. Pomona College

## Non-canonical Objects in Mandarin Chinese
* I revisited the structures and semantics of non-canonical objects (NCOs, i.e., unselected objects) in Mandarin Chinese. I show a novel empirical generalization that there are three structually different types of NCOs, of each type the structure is derived by independent motivations. 
* Outputː
  * In prep. Revisiting Non-canonical Objects in Mandarin Chinese.
