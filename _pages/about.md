I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/), advised by Andrew Simpson. I am interested in the structure of natural language and how it maps onto meaning and sound. Outside of linguistics, I love music.<br>
I go by Zhixian (IPA pronunciation: [ʈ͡ʂi33 ɕiɛn35]).
