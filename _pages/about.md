Hello there, I'm Zhixian ([ʈ͡ʂi33 ɕiɛn35])ǃ 👋<br>
I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/), advised by Andrew Simpson. I am interested in the structure of natural language and how it maps onto meaning and sound. Outside of linguistics, I love music.
