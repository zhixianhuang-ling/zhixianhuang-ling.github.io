Hello there, I'm Zhixian ([ÊˆÍ¡Ê‚i33 É•iÉ›n35])Çƒ ðŸ‘‹<br>
I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/), advised by Andrew Simpson. I am interested in the structure of natural language and how it maps onto meaning and sound. More specifically, I am currently interested in Argument structure and Linearization. I work primarily on Mandarin Chinese and my home variety Jiaxing Wu Chinese, of which I am a native speaker. Outside of linguistics, I love music.
